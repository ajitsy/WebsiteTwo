Synopsis:

A user friendly website for charities interested in receiving free web development help. This is a sister website for Agile Ventures, which is a website that offers web development experience to programmers in order to level-up their skills whilst working on real world projects for charities and non-profit organisations.

This was a 5-person team effort and produced as part of [MakersAcademy's](http://www.makersacademy.com/) final group project.

The client for this project was [Sam Joseph](https://github.com/tansaku), who is the man behind Agile Ventures.
